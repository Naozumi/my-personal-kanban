Nao's My Personal Kanban (NMPK)
==========================

This is a small and simple in-browser application that aspire to be offline Personal Kanban board.

It is a single page JavaScript application with very basic functionality. 

## Basis

This is based on the original version by [Greg Gigon](https://github.com/greggigon), with some slight Quality of Life improvements.

## Why

I was not allowed to use an online hosted tool due to various security concerns so, I started using this. I quickly added a couple of changes and so forked this repo.

### Future

I will likely keep adding to this tool as long as I continue to use it.

## Additional Features over the Original

  - [x] Auto hide nav bars
  - [x] Thin nav bars - shows more content
  - [x] Auto resize - no more 800px fixed size
  
## Desires
  
  - [ ] Resize when colum created, not just on window resize
  - [ ] Tags
  - [ ] File storage - I don't fully trust web browser storage
  - [ ] Simple conversion to Electron (which is how I use this anyway)
  - [ ] Fix the colour picker
